This directory contains assorted examples and analysis scripts related
to electron selection.

exampleElectronQuantities.C: 
   This script reads in a standard ntuple from ElectronNtupler,
   loops over events, for each event loops over electrons in this 
   event, and plots some basic quantities. It contains also the
   list of all available variables, in a commented out form.
   To run it, first change it to point to the location of the
   ntuples (in the beginning of the file, change the fileName const). Then:
   root -l
     .L exampleElectronQuantities.C+
     exampleElectronQuantities();

exampleDielectrons.C:
   This script reads in a standard ntuple from the ElectronNtupler,
   and loops over events. For each event there is a nested loop over
   electrons that makes dielectron candidates. The dielectron invariant
   mass is computed and plotted for all pairs, and also for pairs where
   both electrons pass some quality cuts.
     In this script, we read two ntuples: the Drell-Yan signal sample
   ntuple, and also the TTbar ntuple that would represent background.
   The two ntuples are joined into a single events tree.
   To run it, change the path to the file names (fileNameSignal, 
   fileNameBackground const in the beginning of the file), and then:
   root -l
    .L exampleDielectrons.C+
    exampleDielectrons();
